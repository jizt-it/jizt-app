          "SpaceX announced Monday that it will fly a space tourism flight as early as the fourth quarter of this year, billing it as the first \"all-civilian\" mission to space.\nA tech entrepreneur named Jared Isaacman has financed the mission, named \"Inspiration4,\" and will serve as commander aboard the autonomous Crew Dragon spacecraft. Isaacman, 37, is a pilot rated to fly commercial and military aircraft, but he has no formal astronaut training. He is founder and chief executive officer of Shift4 Payments, a digital payments company.\n\"My passion for aviation and the dream of going to space has really been lifelong,\" Isaacman said during a news conference.\nIsaacman clearly wants to go to space, but he also intends the four-person mission to spread goodwill back on Earth. So he has committed to donating \$100 million to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and is raffling off one of the seats to US citizens who donate at least \$10 to the hospital. Another seat will go to a \"St. Jude ambassador,\" presumably chosen by the hospital. The final seat with be chosen via an entrepreneurial competition in collaboration with his company, Shift4 Payments.\n\"This is an important milestone toward enabling access to space for everyone,\" said Elon Musk in a call with reporters. \"Because, at first, things are very expensive, and it is only through missions like this that we're able to bring the cost down over time and make space accessible to all.\"\nThe announcement comes less than a week after Axiom Space announced the four crew members of its \"first private crew\" to visit the International Space Station. That Crew Dragon mission will be commanded by Axiom employee and former astronaut Michael López-Alegría, with three customers who are paying about \$55 million each to dock to the International Space Station for about eight days. Given that this \"Ax-1 mission\" is due to launch no earlier than January 2022, it seems likely that Isaacman's Inspiration4 mission will fly first.\nAccording to SpaceX, Isaacman and the Inspiration4 crew will undergo commercial astronaut training by the company on the Falcon 9 launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft, including \"a specific focus on orbital mechanics, operating in microgravity, zero gravity, and other forms of stress testing.\" The multiday mission will launch from historic Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. As a \"free flyer\" mission, it will not dock with the International Space Station.\nThis second announced commercial mission for Crew Dragon sets up an extremely busy period for the program. Beginning with the Crew-1 mission for NASA in November 2020, SpaceX could fly as many as five crewed missions during a 15-month period, including three human spaceflights for NASA.\nThis also appears to bode well for SpaceX's efforts to use Crew Dragon for more than just NASA missions, suggesting there may be a market for orbital tourism in which going into orbit around Earth is a destination in and of itself.",

          "Transparent wood just got even better, moving us a step closer to windows that are far better insulators than traditional glass ones.\nThe standard process for making wood transparent typically involves soaking the wood in a vat of sodium chlorite – a chemical compound used in some bleaches and toothpastes – to remove a structural component of the wood called lignin. However, this takes a lot of chemicals, produces liquid waste that is tough to recycle and can weaken the wood.\nLiangbing Hu at the University of Maryland and his colleagues came up with a method that modifies the lignin instead of removing it completely. It is quicker and uses fewer materials than the standard lignin-removal process, and also leaves the wood stronger.\nThe researchers’ method stems from the recent discovery that lignin can be made transparent by removing only the parts of its molecules that give them their colour. They brushed hydrogen peroxide, which is often used as a disinfectant, over the surface of the wood and then left it under a UV lamp designed to simulate natural sunlight. After soaking the wood in ethanol to remove any remaining gunk, they filled the pores in the wood with clear epoxy, a step that is also part of making lignin-free transparent wood.\nThe final product is a piece of wood that allows more than 90 per cent of light to pass through it and is more than 50 times stronger than transparent wood with the lignin completely removed. “The transparent wood is lighter and stronger than glass. It could be used for load-bearing windows and roofs,” says Hu. “It can be potentially used to make a see-through house.”",

          "The deep-sea oil and gas industry has a vast and costly infrastructure to maintain. Wells, other equipment, and thousands of kilometers of pipeline must be installed, inspected and repaired.\nNow, cutting-edge underwater drones and robots are being developed that could make the work safer, cheaper and less polluting.\nAmong them is Eelume, a six-meter-long, snake-like robot kitted out with sensors and a camera at each end. It can be kept at a docking station at depths up to 500 meters (547 yards) for six months, without being brought back to the surface.\nThe self-propelling robot can travel up to 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) before needing to return to its station to recharge. It can also swap out parts for different tasks, including tools to operate subsea valves, and cleaning brushes to remove marine growth and sediments.\nMaintenance work at many deep-water wells and pipeline systems is already carried out by unmanned vehicles. But these vehicles typically need to be transported to the offshore site on a fully crewed ship and then remotely operated from onboard the surface vessel. That can cost up to \$100,000 per day, according to Pål Liljebäck, chief technology officer with Eelume Subsea Intervention, which developed the robot.\nBased in Trondheim, Norway, the company was spun off from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. Liljebäck says that by \"enabling the robot to become a subsea resident living in a docking station, it can be mobilized at any time to do inspections and intervention tasks, and thereby reducing the need for costly surface vessels.\"\nEelume can work autonomously on tasks assigned from a control room onshore, and send back video and data. Its snake-like design allows it to work in confined spaces and wriggle its body to stay in place in strong currents. By docking under the sea, it can be deployed whatever the conditions on the surface of the ocean.",

          "Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, SpaceX, and many other companies, has mastered the art of using Twitter to harness fans and promote himself and his interests across as wide an audience as possible. Using some of that momentum, last night he made a vocal debut on a newer platform — Silicon Valley’s hottest startup right now, Clubhouse, which lets people join rooms to listen in on conversations between hosts and guests.\nMusk, fielding a series of mostly softball questions, used the session to “talk to his base” on topics ranging from space travel, colonies on Mars, crypto, AI and Covid-19 vaccines.\nHe managed to bust a few myths about his “alternative” positions on several subjects, and at times managed to sound far more nuanced than his meme-propelled, trolling Twitter feed. For example, in contrast to previous expositions on the viability of living on Mars, Musk didn’t paint a rose-colored vision in his conversation. Instead, he said that while Mars exploration is a worthwhile effort to keep humankind alive, life would be hard.\nThe last quarter of the interview then veered off radically when Vlad Tenev, CEO of Robinhood, was brought in (apparently by Musk, but there was a hint of co-ordination behind the scenes).\nSuddenly, Musk turned interviewer and had Tenev unpack what had happened in the last week with the Wall Street Bets debacle.\nSome saw the Clubhouse room as a massive PR stunt by the VC firm Andreessen Horowitz — which, in addition to being a big investor in Robinhood and Clubhouse, backs startups that work with Musk’s companies.\nWith more than 5,000 people in the room (breaking Clubhouse’s previously maintained limits), hundreds of journalists and live streams on YouTube, we did get a little taste of how A16Z’s new media efforts — which effectively seek to disintermediate journalists in the public discourse about technology — might work.\nAnd from the looks of events like last night’s, like it or leave it, for now at least, it’s a part of the mix.",
